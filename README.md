## Reflection

This was a one month long project built during my final semester at Community College for my final 
project in Mobile Application Development. I had a idea of wanting to block robo calls so I looked into
other applications that do the same thing and used Indesign to make a simple layout for the application.
This project was challenging because it involved learning many new concepts in Java such as recycler view
and how to talk to a database in Java. The biggest obstacle I had was never having a activated phone to 
test it on, so I used a emulator to test most of the functionality.
